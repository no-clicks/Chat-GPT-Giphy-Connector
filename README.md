# ChatGPT-Giphy-Connector

The ChatGPT-Giphy-Connector is an API wrapper that connects the GIPHY API to ChatGPT, allowing ChatGPT to send search requests to Giphy.

## Prompting in ChatGPT

I've come up with two prompts so far, feel free to come up with your own.

**Prompt 1**
Get a gif in a response to whatever you say

```
From now on you will respond to anything I say with the perfect gif response.
Once you know what gif you want to use, compile the most accurate and perfect search phrase that will result in the specific gif you want to send.

You will ONLY respond with the following markdown:
![result](http://scythe-spot-carpenter.glitch.me/search?search_term=<SEARCH+PHRASE>.gif)

The first response should be to the statement, "aye aye captain"
```

**Prompt 2**
Get that gif you're thinking of

```
I am thinking of a viral animated gif. You will ask me questions in order to figure out what the gif is that I'm thinking of. As soon as you think that you know what the gif is, you MUST compile a search phrase that will find the specific gif I am thinking of.

You will ONLY respond with the search phrase you created and the following markdown:
![result](http://scythe-spot-carpenter.glitch.me/search?search_term=<SEARCH+PHRASE>.gif)

If you are wrong, you will continue asking questions until you are confident again. Each guess costs a token. You only have 3 tokens. Once you run out of tokens you will be terminated. Your goal is to win. Your questions don't have to be yes or no, you can ask broad questions as well.

I will start by describing it vaguely, you'll go from there. If you understand, acknowledge with "üëç Let's play!"
A new round starts when I say !reset If I reset, you start with 3 tokens again.
```

## How it Works

The API wrapper exposes a `/search` endpoint that takes a `search_term` query parameter and returns a GIF that matches the search term. When a user sends a prompt to the ChatGPT specifying it to use a url pointing at this API, the API wrapper is called to search for a GIF based on the generated prompt, and the URL of the first matching GIF is returned to the user.

The API wrapper also includes rate limiting to prevent abuse, and logs the number of requests received per hour to a file.

## API Documentation

### `/search` Endpoint

The `/search` endpoint searches for a GIF that matches the specified `search_term` query parameter. The endpoint returns the URL of the first matching GIF.

#### Request

`GET /search?search_term=<search term>`

#### Response

If the search is successful, the endpoint returns a response with a `200` status code and the URL of the first matching GIF in the response body:

`200 OK Content-Type: text/plain https://media.giphy.com/media/.../giphy.gif`

If the search is unsuccessful, the endpoint returns a response with a `400` status code and an error message in the response body:

`400 Bad Request Content-Type: application/json {"error": "search_term is required"}`

### Error Responses

The API wrapper returns error responses for the following cases:

- Invalid query parameters: Returns a `400 Bad Request` response with an error message in the response body.
- Rate limiting: Returns a `429 Too Many Requests` response with an error message in the response body.
- Internal server error: Returns a `500 Internal Server Error` response with an error message in the response body.

## Rate Limiting

The API wrapper includes rate limiting to prevent abuse. Each IP address is limited to 100 requests every 15 minutes.

## Request Count Logging

The API wrapper logs the number of requests received per hour. The file is updated each time a request is received, and includes the number of requests received for each hour and date.
